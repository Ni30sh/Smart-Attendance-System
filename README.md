Smart Attendance System
Overview
The Smart Attendance System is an intelligent and efficient way to track attendance using facial recognition technology. The system leverages machine learning and computer vision to identify individuals and mark their attendance automatically. This project eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking and enhances accuracy and convenience.

Features
Facial Recognition: Uses state-of-the-art facial recognition to identify individuals.
Real-Time Attendance: Captures attendance in real-time through a webcam or pre-recorded video feed.
Database Integration: Stores attendance records in a structured database for easy retrieval and analysis.
Duplicate Prevention: Automatically overrides attendance for the same individual if already marked, ensuring up-to-date records.
Daily Records: Maintains separate attendance records for each day in dynamically generated tables.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for viewing and managing attendance.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
Face Recognition
Tkinter (GUI)
MySQL Connector (Database Integration)
Database: MySQL
Hardware:
Webcam for real-time video capture
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
MySQL installed and configured.
Necessary Python libraries installed. Use the following command to install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python face-recognition mysql-connector-python tk
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-attendance-system.git
cd smart-attendance-system
Set up the MySQL database:

Create a new database (e.g., attendance_db).
Update the database credentials in the script.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
How It Works
Database Initialization:

The application initializes by checking and creating required database tables.
Mark Attendance:

Detects faces using a webcam.
Matches detected faces with stored data in the database.
Marks attendance as "Present" for recognized faces.
View Attendance:

Allows users to view daily attendance records through a graphical interface.
Override Existing Records:

Ensures attendance for individuals is up-to-date by overriding previous entries.
